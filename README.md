## Testing Coverage

The main issue we are dealing with in terms of testing is <Link> components. Currently, our test for the SignUp page fails, citing problems with the <Link> components, which is why coverage for that file is low.

## How to Run
To run our website, use the `npm start` command. Navigate to other pages using the navbar at the top. If the page has not been created yet then you will just be returned to the landing page.
